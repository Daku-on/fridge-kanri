- get good's name by using Yahoo API from JAN code

ChatGPT
Sure, I can help you with that. However, please note that Yahoo API is no longer available since its retirement in 2021. Nevertheless, I can provide you with a sample code that uses the Yahoo Product Search API to retrieve the name of a product from its JAN code. Please note that you will need to use a different API or source to retrieve product information.


Here's an example code in Python that makes a request to the Yahoo Product Search API and retrieves the name of the product from its JAN code:

python
Copy code
import requests
import json

# Enter your Yahoo API key
yahoo_api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'

# Enter the JAN code of the product you want to search for
jan_code = '4901777333152'

# Make a request to the Yahoo Product Search API
url = 'https://shopping.yahooapis.jp/ShoppingWebService/V1/json/itemSearch'
params = {
    'appid': yahoo_api_key,
    'jan': jan_code,
    'hits': '1',
    'availability': '1'
}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)

# Parse the JSON response
data = json.loads(response.text)

# Extract the name of the product
product_name = data['ResultSet']['0']['Result']['0']['Name']

# Print the name of the product
print(product_name)
In this example, you need to replace the yahoo_api_key variable with your Yahoo API key. You can obtain an API key by registering for a Yahoo Developer account and creating a new application.

The jan_code variable is set to the JAN code of the product you want to search for. You can replace it with any valid JAN code.

The API request is made using the requests library, and the response is parsed using the json library. The name of the product is extracted from the JSON response and stored in the product_name variable, which is then printed to the console.

- get jan code from stdin by barcode scanner as  an external device

ChatGPT
Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an example Python code that reads input from a barcode scanner connected to the computer's USB port and retrieves the JAN code:

python
Copy code
import sys
import usb.core
import usb.util

# Find the USB device corresponding to the barcode scanner
dev = usb.core.find(idVendor=0xXXXX, idProduct=0xXXXX)

if dev is None:
    raise ValueError('Device not found')

# Detach the device from the kernel driver if it is attached
if dev.is_kernel_driver_active(0):
    dev.detach_kernel_driver(0)

# Set the configuration of the device
dev.set_configuration()

# Read input from the device
jan_code = ''
while True:
    try:
        data = dev.read(0x81, 64, timeout=100)
        jan_code += data.decode('utf-8').strip()
    except usb.core.USBError as e:
        if e.args == ('Operation timed out',):
            break

# Print the JAN code
print(jan_code)
In this example, you need to replace the idVendor and idProduct values with the corresponding values of your barcode scanner. You can use the lsusb command in Linux or the Device Manager in Windows to find these values.

The code uses the usb.core and usb.util modules to communicate with the USB device. It first finds the device based on its vendor and product IDs, and then sets its configuration. It then reads input from the device using a while loop, appending each chunk of data to the jan_code variable until the read operation times out. Finally, the JAN code is printed to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the barcode scanner emulates a keyboard and sends the scanned code as keystrokes. If your barcode scanner uses a different communication protocol, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

- make GUI window to enter JAN code without using package tkinter

ChatGPT
If you don't want to use the tkinter package to create a GUI window, you can use other third-party packages such as PyQt or wxPython. Here's an example code using PyQt to create a simple GUI window that allows the user to enter a JAN code:

python
Copy code
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel, QLineEdit, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout

class JanCodeWindow(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Set the window properties
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 300, 150)
        self.setWindowTitle('Enter JAN Code')

        # Create the JAN code label and input field
        self.jan_label = QLabel('JAN Code:')
        self.jan_input = QLineEdit()

        # Create the OK button
        self.ok_button = QPushButton('OK')
        self.ok_button.clicked.connect(self.on_ok_clicked)

        # Create the layout
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.jan_label)
        layout.addWidget(self.jan_input)
        layout.addWidget(self.ok_button)
        self.setLayout(layout)

    def on_ok_clicked(self):
        jan_code = self.jan_input.text()
        print(jan_code)
        self.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = JanCodeWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
This code creates a QWidget window with a label, an input field, and a button. When the user clicks the button, the JAN code entered in the input field is printed to the console.

To run this code, you need to have PyQt5 installed. You can install it using pip by running the command pip install PyQt5.
